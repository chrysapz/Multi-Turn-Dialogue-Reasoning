# Exploring the Effects of Data Augmentation on Dialogue Reasoning. 

**Note: This project is currently a work in progress.**

To enhance reasoning, datasets like MuTual emphasize complex reasoning challenges. Our approach incorporates generative models like Llama 2 to create synthetic labels, with the aim of evaluating their impact on dialogue system performance.
